#Converts RelaxNG to Katydid

Katydid still requires some work to fully support XML.
When this is done testing of the translations can start.

the list is element is not working yet.

## Known Issues

There are quite a few known issues:
  - namespaces are not supported
  - more datatypes (only string and token are currently supported)
  - datatypeLibraries: there are none
  - only simplified grammars are supported

I don't really intend to fix these, but you never know.

### Only handles simplified relaxng grammars.

[http://www.kohsuke.org/relaxng/rng2srng/](rng2srng) seems to be quite effective at converting the full spectrum of what is possible within the relaxng grammar to the simplified grammar.

```
java -jar rng2srng.jar full.rng > simplified.rng
```
